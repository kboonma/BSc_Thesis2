                        Viper scans your work against over 10 billion web pages and work previously 
                        submitted to our firm. Once the scan is completed, the report delivers content 
                        that may match these other sources, including links to the sites that contain 
                        the same content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b class="red-text">What Do the Results Mean?</b><br />
                        If the report sends back positive matches to content found elsewhere, there is no need to panic and assume you have plagiarised your work. Instead, review the report carefully and consider the following:
                       
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Is the material an entire quote, a sentence, or a fragment of 4-5 words often found together? Viper will show a match where there is a string of five or more 
                        words that are the same as your work. Even if this is not actually plagiarism, it is important that Viper does not ignore these fragments as they draw your 
                        attention to any sentences where the writer has &#39;rephrased&#39; parts of the 
                        original material without referencing the source.
                        </li> 
                            
                        <li>If it was intended to be a quote that you were going to attribute to the source, 
                            did you remember to properly reference it? Sometimes, Viper will identify 
                            matching material that is available on websites, but the reference might have 
                            been found within another source. Just because the work has content that matches 
                            a particular website does not mean that every possible source where it appears 
                            has to be referenced. Just make sure that at least one reference covers that 
                        content.
						</li>
                        <li>Did you actually use a footnote and it was just simply not picked up by Viper? 
                            This review is just a means of double-checking that all references have been 
                            included.
						</li>
                        <li>Could Viper have just picked up a phrase that you used more than once in your 
                            document? This may be a way to ensure that your writing is tight rather than 
                            repetitive or relies on overly used phrases.
						</li>    
                        <li>Did you use too many direct quotes? Viper checks for direct quotes and delivers 
                            an overall percentage of words it views as direct quotes. Clearly, this should 
                            not be too high as work that relies too heavily on other material is not 
                            &#39;original&#39;.
						</li>
                        </ul>
                            <b class="red-text">A Guide on Viper Results</b>
                            <br/>This guide explains how Viper can identify matching content when it scans your work:
                            <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% or less : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that it is highly unlikely that this document contains plagiarised material. A careful check will only be necessary if this is a lengthy document. For example, a 6% result within a 15,000 word essay would be of concern because it could mean that direct quotes are too lengthy or there are too many places where a reference was not listed.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 6% - 12% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a low risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. Most of the matching content will probably be fragments. Review your report for any sections that may not have been referenced properly.<br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 13% - 20% : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a medium risk that the document contains any plagiarised material. There may be sections that match websites so it is important to check that proper credit was attributed to the other sources. The scan may not have detected quotation marks or footnotes that were used. For example, if an opening quotation mark was included but there was not a closing quotation mark, then this could explain the higher result. <br/>
                            <br/><b class="red-text">Overall plagiarism rating 21%+ : </b>
                            <br/>The results are that there is a high risk that the document contains plagiarised material. If the overall rating is this high, you need to check your report very carefully. It may be that there are a lot of matching fragments and the software has not identified all direct quotes , but it is critical that you go through the entire document and address every phrase or fragment that the scan has flagged to reduce this percentage.<br/>

                        <p>The University of Edinburgh Senior Honours Project Report BSc GEOPHYSICS Improving the prediction of magnetic disturbances from solar wind parameters Student: Kittiphon Boonma Supervisor: Dr.Brian Hamilton 04/04/2014Abstract Magnetic indices are used as a measure of the intensity of various geomagnetic ac- tivities. Dst index measures the strength of the equatorial Ring Current. A previous study by Newell et al. (2007) proposed a function, dMP =dt, which is said to give the best correlation between the solar wind parameters and the geomagnetic indices. The coupling function ESR was claimed to be the second best. This study aims to investigate these claims by applying corrections to indicies and using new data (2000-2013) which the previous study did not have. Dst index measures both the ring current (Est index), and the induced current in the conducting Earth (Ist index). This gives rise to the idea of improving the prediction model of the geomagnetic disturbances by replacing the Dst index with Est index, and the Ist is eliminated because it is not directly correlate with the solar wind parameters. The analytical results from this study conrms that the cor- relation between the top coupling function with Dst can be improved by replacing it with Est index. However, this is not the case for the second best function, ESR. An addi- tional hypothesis is that the measure of auroral electrojet indices, AU and AL, is partly contributed from the ring current. The results from the investigation conrmed the hy- pothesis since about 8% of the AU index and 6% of the AL index were the contribution from the x-component of the ring current. Removing the eect of ring current improves AU index but worsens AL index. Overall, since the claimed top function dMP =dt was not consistently better than ESR when changes were introduced, it is suce to say that the dMP =dt function is not as robust and correlate best with every indices as Newell et al. (2007) claimed it to be.Contents 1 Introduction 2 1.1 Solar wind and Magnetosphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1.2 Current Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.2.1 Magnetopause Current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.2.2 Ring-current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.3 Geomagnetic Indices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 1.3.1 Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) Index . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 1.3.2 Est and Ist Indices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 1.3.3 Auroral-Electrojet (AE) Indices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 1.4 Coupling Functions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 1.4.1 dMP /dt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 1.4.2 ESR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 2 Data 11 2.1 Solar Wind Parameters, Dst, AU, and AL Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2.2 Est and Ist Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2.3 Correction on Dst Index data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2.4 Time Integration of Solar Wind for Each Index . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 3 Method 14 3.1 Main Code . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 3.2 Correction of the AU and AL indices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 4 Results 17 4.1 Correlation between Dst and p1=2dMP =dt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 4.2 Correlation between Est and p1=2dMP =dt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 4.3 Correlation between Dst and ESR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 4.4 Correlation between AU and dMP =dt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 4.5 Correlation between AL and dMP =dt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 5 Discussion and Conclusion 24 Bibliography 26 A Main MATLABr code 28 1Chapter 1 Introduction The monitoring and accurate prediction of magnetic disturbances in the Earth's upper atmosphere, the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, has become increasingly important due to the expansion of human activity at high altitudes, in space, and on the ground where sensitive technologies, such as power grids and directional drilling for oil and gas, can be aected. Understanding the coupling mechanisms and how the solar wind aects the Earth's magnetic eld is crucial. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively assess the underlying statistical and correlating models. Geomagnetic indices represent a measure of geomagnetic activity, which is a key signature of how the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere respond to forces from solar wind. There are many types of indices, each describing dierent magnetic conguration of the Earth's ionised environment. For the past 15 years in the eld of Solar Terrestrial studies, these indices have become a key parameter in detecting and describing space weather events. The overall aim of this study is to investigate the improvements on geomagnetic indices ( Dst, Est, AU, and AL) and their ability to be predicted by the solar wind parameters. There are three parts to the investigation: First The rst hypothesis is that it may be more correct to predict the Est index, rather than the Dst index (as many scientists have done in the past). The correlation between the indices and a coupling function is used to test this hypothesis. Second We investigate on the hypothesis of the possibility of improving the AU and AL indices by subtracting any contaminating eects arise from an external source such as ring current. Again, using coupling functions, it can be tested whether the corrected AU and AL indices correlate with solar wind parameters better than the uncorrected version. Third A study previously done by Newell et al. (2007) has found a good correlation with the Dst index and claimed that dMP =dt is the best coupling function.The analysis from this study will be used to test if the claim stands up to scrutiny, especially with the new data (up to 2013) which Newell et al. (2007) did not have. The corrected indices will also be used to test the claim, and the investigation will extend into looking at the second best coupling function ESR (claimed by Newell et al. (2007)) as well. 2Figure 1.1: (a) A diagram of the magnetosphere showing the current systems and plasma regions (Source: Russell (2000)). (b) A diagram of a cross-section of the outer magnetosphere, looking towards the Sun. The diagram represents various current systems within the magnetosphere-ionosphere cavity, which give rise to magnetic activity (Source: Modied from McPherron (1995)). This chapter introduces the reader to the project and the underlying physical background. The analytical methods are presented in Chapter 3 (p. 14). The results and corresponding discussions are presented in and Chapter 4(p. 17). 1.1 Solar wind and Magnetosphere Other than solar radiation, solar wind is regarded as the second crucial connection between the Earth and the Sun. The solar wind is dened as a stream of ionized particles ejected from the Sun. Within the solar wind stream, there is an embedded Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF)(Figure 1.1 (a)) which the solar wind carries through the solar system. The solar wind carries this weak magnetic eld past the magnetized Earth, where it controls the strength of the coupling between the upper atmosphere (magnetosphere and ionosphere) and the solar wind. As the Earth travels around the Sun in this dynamical solar-wind environment, the Earth's magnetic eld interacts with the solar ux. The blast of solar wind envelops and deects around the Earth's dipole geomagnetic eld, compressing the magnetosphere to 11 Earth-radii (Re) on the dayside, and stretches the magnetosphere outwards into a long tail, far past the Moon's orbit (60Re) on the nightside (Campbell, 2003). The energy, plasma, and momentum are transfered from the solar wind into the Earth's upper atmosphere through the merging of the Earth's magnetospheric eld lines and the IMF. The magnetopause (Figure 1.1 (a)) is the boundary between the Earth's magnetic eld and the solar wind. The merging process occurs within the magnetopause, however, the merging location depends on the orientation of IMF (Russell, 2000). Figure 1.2 shows the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system 3which is typically used when dealing with the orientation of IMF. Bx lies along the Earth- Sun plane and is positive towards the Sun. By is the cross product of the magnetic dipole Bz) and Bx, and Bz represents the cross product of Bx and By. It is considered the best coordinate system for the study of the eect of IMF components on the magnetospheric phenomena because by applying this system, the direction of the Earth's geomagnetic eld near the `nose' of the magnetosphere is well-ordered. This coordinate system is also applied to the components of the eld used to calculate the IMF clock angle in section 1.4.1. There are two scenarios in which the IMF can merge with the Earth's magnetic eld, both of which are illustrated by the Dungey's Model in Figure 1.3: Figure 1.3 (a) shows the case where IMF is directed southward (Bz<0), and the dayside shrinks by ux ablation. According to the Dungey's Model, with this conguration, the reconnection occurs with closed magnetospheric eld lineson the dayside magnetopause. This leads to the forming of the opened eld lines, which are dragged by the magnetic tension away from the Sun. On the dayside, the energy ows from the magnetic eld into the plasma, however, there are some electromagnetic energy ux at the tail, and this energy ow from the plasma into the magnetic eld (Russell, 2000). The energy transfered into the magnetic eld is stored as magnetic energy in the magnetotail (Menvielle et al., 2011). This stored energy can be released from the tail randomly during violent bursts of energy, called substorms, and causes the plasma to ow into the magnetosphere. The eld and plasma continue to move towards the reconnection point on the dayside, as shown by the green dashed line in Figure 1.1 (a), and the cycle is repeated. Figure 1.3 (b) illustrates the situation when IMF is directed solely northward (Bz>0), and the dayside grows by ux accretion. In this case, the reconnection still occurs, however, the eect on the magnetosphere will be dierent from the previous case. The reconnection occurs with opened magnetospheric eld lines tailward of the cusp (Figure 1.1 (a)). However, the northward-IMF model is not consistent with the results from previous studies on electron data and on solar proton data. Therefore, it is important to note that it is highly doubtful that the same led line would connect to both the north and south neutral points at the tail (Russell , 1972a). To put this into context, these merging events illustrate the physical processes of how the solar wind continually feeds energy into the Earth's atmosphere (Russell, 2000) and aect the magnetosphere and ionosphere. This ultimately produce the disturbances which are measure by the indices, which are studied in this project. Therefore, it is justiable and appropriate to consider solar wind based coupling functions (Section 1.4). The northward directed IMF usually causes less disturbance and, hence, smaller indices. This explains the importance of the clock angle term (Equation 1.7 in the coupling functions. 4Figure 1.2: Diagram showing the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system. x-axis is Earth-Sun line and is positive towards the Sun. y-axis is the cross product of the magnetic dipole axis and the x-axis. z-axis is the cross product of x- and y-axes.

Both of which are described below. 1.2.1 Magnetopause Current There are several sources of electric currents co-existing within the magnetosphere- ionosphere system. They can be either directly or indirectly associated with the dynam- ical interaction between the Earth's environments and the Sun (Menvielle et al., 2011). This study mainly focuses on the currents arise from the interaction between the Earth's magnetic eld and the solar wind. One of the current system, namely Magnetopause Current, will be described in this section. The Magnetopause Current, or also known as `Chapman-Ferraro Current', is the basic nature of the interaction between the Earth's magnetic eld and the solar wind. The existence of such current system was rst deduced in 1930's by Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo Ferraro (Chapman and Ferraro, 1931). Magnetopause represents a surface of current layer (Figure 1.1 (a)), and separates the solar wind (high density, low magnetic elds (B)) from the magnetosphere (low density, high magnetic elds (B)). In the rst approximation, magnetopause forms at a distance of about 8-11 Rewhere the magnetic pressure of the Earth's eld equals the dynamic pressure of the solar wind (Menvielle et al., 2011). As the solar wind particles begin to penetrate the magnetopause they experience the Lorentz force provided by the magnetopause current, which deects the electrons and protons of the solar wind in opposite directions normal to the eld, shielding the Earth's magnetic eld from the solar wind. This magnetopause current, shown in Figure 1.1 (b), ows towards dusk on the dayside, and towards dawn on the nightside magnetopause where it is called the tail current (Figure 1.1 (b)). A type of current called the Neutral Sheet Current ows duskward in the magnetic equatorial plane acts as a barrier conning the tail part of the magnetopause current inside the magnetosphere (Figure 1.1 (a)). From the right-hand rule, it can be speculated that the ground magnetic eld will be aected by a southward perturbation. 1.2.2 Ring-current Ring current is produced from the eastward drift of electrons and the westward drift of protons in a ring around the magnetic equator of the Earth at a distance of 3-5 Re (Figure 1.1), where the magnetic eld is approximately dipolar (Menvielle et al., 2011). Burton et al. (1975) used what was understood, regarding the control of the reconnection process of IMF, to demonstrate that the ring current could be predicted from solar wind parameters. The amount of convected southward IMF is proportional to the injection rate of the energy that goes into the ring current (Le et al., 2004). Similar to the tail current, the ring current ows duskward on the Earth's magnetic equatorial plane, and by applying the right-hand rule, its ground eect is the reduction in the main eld strength at low latitudes due to the southward perturbation, similar to the eect of the magnetopause current. For the purpose of this study, ring current is important because its strength directly varies in response to the solar wind. Since the ring current is associated with the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, the solar wind parameters can be studied through Dst index, which measures the strength of the ring current. 6Figure 1.4: A graph showing Hourly Equatorial Dst Values of July 2000. The y-axis is H-component of the eld, while the x-axis represents each day of the month. The increase in Dst (circled) amplitude prior a large drop is a result of magnetospheric compression. The large decrease in Dst amplitude signies the main phase of the storm. (Source: World Data Centre for Geomagnetism, Kyoto) 1.3 Geomagnetic Indices 1.3.1 Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) Index During a period of intense solar activity, the southward IMF that merge with the Earth's magnetic eld are strong and have long duration. The reconnection occurs at the `nose' of the magnetosphere (Figure 1.3 (a)) and causes compression of the magnetosphere on the day side and continue down the tail. This compression distorts the Earth's dipole eld and provides an entry for the solar wind particles, which cause the geomagnetic dis- turbances i.e. geomagnetic storms. These storms are the main source that provide energy for the ring current (Section 1.2.2) which has a westward-owing current. This westward current causes a horizontal (H)-component eld depression worldwide (Campbell, 2003). Disturbance Storm Time index (Dst) is one of many geomagnetic indices. It monitors the magnetic storm level worldwide, as well as represents the axially symmetric magnetic disturbance at the dipole equator on the Earth's surface (Menvielle et al., 2011). Dst index is derived from averaging the H-component of the Earth's magnetic eld from well-spaced mid- or low-latitude observatories from all over the world. The severity of the geomagnetic disturbance is represented by the magnitude of the decrease in H-component eld, i.e. the disturbance eld is southward. An example of Dst data is shown in Figure 1.4. The circled area emphasizes on a sharp increase prior to a large drop in amplitude, which is caused by the compression of the magnetosphere, and the following drop after the upward spike is caused by the ring current. The derivation of Dst described in this section is based on Sugiura and Kamei (1991). At a time `t', the Dst(t) is dened as the average of the disturbance variation of H- component of the eld, Di(t), at `n' observatories. In order to normalize the Dst index to the dipole equator, the expression is divided by the average of the cosines of magnetic dipole latitudes of the i-th observatory, i. Thus, Dst can be expressed as: Dst(t) =Xn i=1 Di(t)= Xn i=1 cos(i) (1.1) For further technical details and in-depth derivation, the reader is referred to (Sugiura and Kamei, 1991). Many previous studies have been done in attempt to correlate the Dst 7index, and therefore the ring current strength, with the solar wind parameters such as the bulk plasma speed, strength, and the orientation of the magnetic eld that it carries. This project is looking to see if the correlation could be improve by replacing it with the Est Index. 1.3.2 Est and Ist Indices Geomagnetic eld disturbances are commonly thought to be caused solely by a eld source outside of the Earth's body. However, it has recently been found that the sole external eld source may not always be the case. The disturbance magnetic eld repre- sentations have some diculties due to the secondary eld, which arises from the external time-varying source eld inducing electric currents in the Earth. The strength of this sec- ondary eld is approximately one third of the inducing eld (Maus and Weidelt, 2004). Thus, the eld disturbance observed on the Earth's surface and measured by Dst index is, in fact, the sum of the external source eld and its induced counterpart. A physically correct representation of the symmetric disturbance eld is provided by the internal and external contributions, which are derived by taking a Fourier transform of the Dst index as well as implementing a conductivity model Utada et al (2003). Therefore, the Dst index can be split into the external dipole source eld (Est Index ) and the internal induced dipole eld (Ist Index ). Thus, at any given time; Dst(t) = Est(t) + Ist(t) (1.2) and the corresponding internal and external dipole elds are represented as Bext(t) = ??Est(t)sin ^?? cos ^r(1.3) Bint(t) = ??Ist(t)sin ^+ 2 cos ^r(1.4) where ^is the a unit vector for the local southward, and ^r is the local outward unit vector. The negative signs in Eqn. 1.3 and 1.4 are present because Dst represents the northward eld, while ^points southward. In an ideal conductor, the strength of the induced eld would have its radial component canceling out radial component of the inducing eld on its surface. However, in the case of the real Earth, the amplitude and phase lag relation between the induced internal and induced external eld depends on the frequency content of the external source eld (Maus and Weidelt, 2004). For more mathematical details on separating external and internal parts of the symmetric disturbance eld, the reader is referred to Maus and Weidelt (2004). The signicance of Bext and Bint in this project is that they are used later in section 3.2 for the correction of the AU and AL indices, which will be described next. 1.3.3 Auroral-Electrojet (AE) Indices The Auroral-Electrojet (AE) indices were introduced as a measure of global distur- bances resulting from the auroral electrojet activity, and thus specifying the state of the Earth's upper atmosphere. It should be noted that the term \AE Indices" includes the AU and AL indices, which this study will also focus on, whereas the term \AE Index" is just the AE index itself. AE indices data is maintained at the World Data Center for Geomagnetism in Kyoto, Japan, and has been exploited qualitatively and quantitatively 8as a correlation index in the study eld of radio propagation, substorm morphology, the behaviour of communication satellites, and the magnetosphere-IMF coupling. The AE indices are derived from the geomagnetic variations in the horizontal com- ponent (H) of the main eld observed at the selected observatories along the auroral zone in the northern hemisphere. The variations are measured from a baseline, which is determined for each individual observatory, and then go through a normalization process. For more detail of the normalization process, please refer to Menvielle et al. (2011). In a superimposed plot of one-minute H values from all the AE observatories at each given universal time (UT) the AU index represents the upper envelope of the plotted points, while the AL index represents the lower envelope. The AE value gives the sepa- ration of these envelope: AE = AU ?? AL (1.5) The AU and AL indices are dened by the largest and the smallest values,respectively, selected from the data from all the stations (Menvielle et al., 2011). While the AE index represents a measure of global auroral electrojet activity, the AU index is intended to represent a measure of the strongest current intensity of the eastward auroral electrojet, and the AL index represents a measure of a westward auroral electrojet. Some caution should be taken when using the indices for substorm studies for a number of reasons. One in particular, which is relevant to our study, is that although the indices are generated from ionospheric electrojet current, magnetospheric current such as the equatorial ring current can also aect the indices. Davis and Sugiura (1966) carried out a study and suggested that the negative values of the AU index may have occurred due to the con- tribution from the ring current. This project will also investigate this speculation to see whether the corrected AU and AL indices (Section 3.2) would correlate with the coupling functions better. 1.4 Coupling Functions 1.4.1 dMP/dt The velocity, density, or pressure of the solar wind themselves is unlikely to have much predictive power for the magnetospheric indices. However, it was realized by Dungey (1961) that the IMF is continual and continuously varying, thus, contemplating the im- portance of Bz and the merging between the IMF and the Earth's elds (Section 1.1). There are many dierent coupling functions representing a variety of magnetospheric ac- tivity due to the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The one particular coupling function this project focuses on was proposed by Newell et al. (2007). This function represents the rate magnetic ux is open to the magnetospheric activity, and is presented as; dMP =dt = v4=3B2=3 T sin8=3(c=2) (1.6) where v is the approximated rate at which IMF eld lines approach the magnetopause, BT is the magnitude of the interplanetary eld, and sin8=3(c=2) represents the percentage of the merging IMF lines. The IMF clock angle (c), here, is dened by; c = arctan(By=Bz) (1.7) 9where By and Bz represents the y-component and the z-component of the eld in GSM coordinates (Figure 1.2). The reader is referred to Newell et al. (2007) for an in-depth derivation. The study by Newell et al. (2007) shows that the AU and AL indices both correlate best with this coupling function. However, the Dst index does not correlate best with just dMP =dt alone but with an additional factor of p1=2, which gives p1=2dMP =dt. The term p1=2 was used to correct for the magnetopause currents. This eect was taken into consideration when applying the coupling function to our data set. The coupling function dMP =dt greatly depends on the term involved the IMF clock angle, sin8=3(c=2). Despite the awkward 8/3 exponent, which was a result based on trial and error search through all the possible values, the dependence of dMP =dt on the clock angle is rather straightforward. The physical meaning of sin8=3(c=2) is the fraction of the eld lines impacting the magnetosphere which merge and is a function of the magnetic shear. Newell et al. (2007) also carried out a statistical comparison for the relationship between the IMF clock an- gle and various coupling functions. All the coupling functions, including the dMP =dt, predicted that the greatest amount of eld lines merging is due to the southward IMF (Figure 1.3), and the functions go to zero for a northward IMF. This can also be used to support the statement that says the southward IMF model is preferable over the north- ward IMF, as previously discussed in section 1.1. All in all, the coupling function dMP =dt is chosen by this study because, according to a study done by Newell et al. (2007), it gives a reasonable prediction of a variety of magnetospheric phenomena, and is claimed to have the best correlation with every indices (r > 0.80 in some cases). This study will, therefore, investigate the robustness of this function and how it performs when the corrected indices are used. The second best coupling function ESR, as claimed by Newell et al. (2007), will also be used to test the robustness 1.4.2 ESR This coupling function was proposed by Scurry and Russell (1991) in the study of the transferring of energy into the magnetosphere. The function is represented as; ESR = vBT sin4(c=2)p1=2 (1.8) It examines the relation between the reconnection mechanism and the orientation of the IMF as well as the upstream solar wind parameter. The solar wind parameters required for this coupling function is the same as those used in dMP =dt. In the study done by Newell et al. (2007), ESR gave the second best correlation coecient for Dst (1995-2002) and the third best for Dst (1984-1994). However, ESR does not correlate well with the AU and AL indices at all. In this study, the coupling function ESR is used to test whether the function dMP =dt really is the best coupling function, as claimed by Newell et al. (2007). This investigation will be also be comparing the correlation coecient between ESR and OMNI 2 data with the results from Newell et al. (2007). Only the basic description of this coupling function is given here because it is not the main focus of this study, however, for more details on the ESR function the reader is referred to Scurry and Russell (1991). 10Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Solar Wind Parameters, Dst, AU, and AL Data The solar wind dataset used in this study is called \OMNI 2" data and is obtained from NASA's OMNIWeb Data and Service site (http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov) provided by the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. The OMNI 2 data are a multi-source dataset which contain continuous time-series of solar wind data contributed by several dierent spacecraft. Most of these spacecraft are in geocentric orbit, while some are orbiting the Sun at the Lagrange point. Within the data set, factors such as time-delays between satellites at dierent locations have already been dealt with before the data were published on the site. The particular data set that was used in this study is of low-resolution with hourly average from the year 1963 to 2013. The data set has 55 columns, and the information selected for the purpose of this investigation are: Parameters Column Year 1 Decimal Day 2 Decimal Hour 3 IMF Field Strength, BT (nT) 10 By (nT) 16 Bz (nT) 17 Solar wind speed, v (km/s) 25 Solar wind pressure, p (nPa) 29 Dst Index (nT) 41 AL Index (nT) 53 AU Index (nT) 54 Table 2.1: The column number in which the solar wind parameters are extracted from OMNI 2 data. Note: Bx and By are eld components in GSM coordinates (Figure 1.2) These selected informations are then used to calculate the coupling functions, dMP =dt (Equation 1.6) and ESR(Equation 1.8). Some modications have to be done on some set of data, such as Dst, AU, and AL indices, as well as the solar wind pressure. These modications will be discuss later in Section 2.3 and 2.4. 112.2 Est and Ist Data In this study, the Est index data would be used to replace Dst in the hope of improving the correlation with the coupling function, and therefore improving the prediction of the magnetic disturbances from solar wind parameters. The Est and Ist data were extracted from a set of data which were obtained from the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Directory of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) which is a part of the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The dataset contain the data from 1957 - 2013, and have 4 columns with the rst column being the Julian date, the second is Dst index values, the third column is the Est index value, and the fourth being the Ist index value. 2.3 Correction on Dst Index data As mentioned previously in Section 1.4.1 that there is an additional factor of p1=2 when correlating Dst index with the coupling function. On the sunward side, the magnetopause is compressed and drawn out tailward un- til the magnetic pressure from the magnetosphere balances the dynamic pressure of the incoming solar wind (Russell et al., 1974). This leads to the distortion of the magneto- sphere, which is associated with the magnetopause currents. Therefore, the Dst index will need to correct for this eect by removing an amount proportional to a value of solar wind pressure (p). Due to this correction, the correlation of the coupling function is not with \Dst" but actually with Dst ?? 18:9p1=2 (Newell et al., 2007). 2.4 Time Integration of Solar Wind for Each Index In their study, Newell et al. (2007)worked with 10 indices, each represents a dierent magnetospheric phenomena. Therefore, it was expected that the response of these indices to the solar wind would show a variety in timescales and decay with diering hysteresis. So, it became apparent that time-integration is needed, and that the integration time for a given index is somewhat invariant of the coupling function used (Newell et al., 2007). Although, this investigation is focusing on the coupling function dMP =dt, time in- tegration process can be applied to other coupling functions as well, such as ESR. The coupling function, dMP =dt, was calculated rst at an hourly time resolution before the time integration was done. The process involved separately altering the number of hours of IMF data integrated over, and the weight, w (0 < w < 1), used in the integration. The weighted mean is performed on each and every hourly values, where the weights are wn ( n = the hour before the present). Since the present hour inuences the indices prediction the most, it is therefore the most weighted (w0 = 1), and the hours following that incrementally increase in n (weighting factor decreases) (Newell et al., 2007). The solar wind integration time optimizing each index are shown in Table 2.2. 12Index No. of Hours of IMF w Dst 72 0.95 AU 3 0.77 AL 3 0.69 Table 2.2: The Solar Wind Integration Time for Each Index The Dst index, a measure of the ring current, requires the longest solar wind time integration (72 hours) because the ring current can occur continuously for several days even after dayside merging ceases. This is due to substorm, from the crossing neutral point at the tail of the magnetosphere (Figure 1.3 (a)), injecting energy into the ring current system (refer to section 1.1). Only 3 hours of solar wind time integration is needed for the AU and AL indices because that is roughly the amount of time it takes for the auroral electrojets (refer to section 1.3.3) to return to their normal state after dayside merging ceases (Newell et al., 2007). 13Chapter 3 Method The data was processed using, mainly, MATLABr. Some of the codes used through- out this study were written by the student, while some help and Function codes were provided by the project supervisor, Dr Brian Hamilton (BGS). Several dierent codes were written since this study investigates the correlation between the coupling functions, dMP =dt and ESR, with dierent geomagnetic indices. This section will describe the processing steps implemented within dierent codes. 3.1 Main Code The main code was written by the student to investigate the correlation between the coupling functions and the indices. The steps implemented in the main code (Ap- pendix A) are used to process dierent indices and coupling functions, therefore the description of each step is kept as general as possible. The implemented steps are: 1. The code started by importing the OMNI 2 data and the solar wind parameters needed were extracted. In the case of Est, the code imports the data from the NOAA data set and the Est index values were then extracted. 2. The clock angle (c) was then calculated using the Equation 1.7. This is the same for every coupling functions used in this study. 3. The coupling function was calculated using the Equation 1.6 for dMP =dt, and Equation 1.8 for ESR. 4. The OMNI 2 data contain a lot of missing data comparing to the data Newell et al. (2007) used in their study. The missing data appeared to have very large value such as 99.99 nPa for the solar wind pressure (p), 9999 km/s for the solar wind speed (v), and 999.9 nT for the IMF eld strength (BT ), the y-component (By), and the z-component (Bz). Any row of data with at least one missing data would be marked as a faulty row. 5. A moving integration was performed because we wanted to select out continuous blocks of complete data points. This involved integrating a block of set-length dimension with a long hourly time-series data. The length of this `block' is deter- mined by the solar wind integration time i.e. the block should have 72 rows for Dst and Est indices, and 3 rows for AU and AL indices. By doing this, data points with the required number of good and complete hours would be selected. Any data points that did not have the required number of good hours preceding them were agged as bad. 146. The time integration of solar wind for the index was then implemented. The Dst and Est indices are best predicted by integrating over 72 hours of the solar wind data and 3 hours for the AU and AL indices, with the hour n-hours previous to the present receiving the relative weight of wn. For example, the current hour inuences the index prediction the most so it is weighted with w0 which is 1, the previous hour is weighted w1, two hours earlier is weighted w2, and etc. The expression was also, then, divided by the sum of all the weighting factor terms i.e. Pn0 wn (weighted mean). As mentioned in Section 2.3 that the Dst index were corrected with a term pro- portional to p1=2. Therefore, the solar wind pressure term, p1=2 was also evaluated over previous 72 hours. 7. The data selection process in step 5 picked out blocks of either 72 or 3 complete data, this meant leaving an empty array of 71 or 2 rows at the beginning. The resulting time-series data would, therefore, need to be padded in order to build the data array up to the correct dimension required for future process. Thus, both the coupling function and solar wind pressure data were padded. 8. The faulty rows marked earlier in step 4 could now be removed from the data set. 9. The correlation coecient between the coupling function and the index was calcu- lated using the built-in `corrcoef' function in MATLABr. 10. Lastly, the results were plotted. These ten steps are the core of every codes used in this study. Equations and parameters were altered in order to investigate other dierent correlations. In order to investigate this correlation, Dst index values (from OMNI 2 data) used in the processes described in Section 3.1 were simply replaced by Est index values (NOAA). The rest of the code remained unchanged. For the investigation of the correlation between dMP =dt and AU and AL, again, the Dst values were simply replaced by either AU or AL values from the same data set (OMNI 2). Due to both AU and AL having dierent solar wind time integration from that of Dst (refer to Table 2.2), this would need to be adjusted accordingly. Lastly, in order to investigate the correlation between Dst index and its corresponding second best coupling function (Newell et al., 2007), ESR, the dMP =dt was replaced by ESR (Equation 1.8). The solar wind parameters and the time-integration stayed unaltered (from Section 3.1). 3.2 Correction of the AU and AL indices There are two spherical harmonic expansions in the general solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, the eld associated with the external and internal source. The spherical harmonic expansions take the form; V = a 1Xl=1 Xl m=0 arl+1(gml cosm+ hmlsinm)Pml () + ral(qml cosm+ smlsinm)Pml ()(3.1) where V is the potential function and a is the Earth's radius. The integers, l and m, are called degree and order, respectively. The degree, l, has a value of 1 or greater, while m is always less than or equal to l. The weighting coecients gml , hml, qml , and smlare known 15as Gauss Coecient (Campbell, 2003) and are measured in nT. The term Pml () is the Legendre polynomials, and and are longitude and colatitude, respectively. The part of Equation 3.1 with the coecients gml and hmlrepresents the internal sources, while the part with qml and smlrepresents external sources. As previously mentioned in Section 1.3.2 that the Est and Ist indices are, respectively, the external and internal parts of the Dst index. The Est and Ist values are the external and internal spherical harmonic coecients of a simple degree 1 representation of the magnetopsheric eld and the induced eld. Since the Est and Ist indices are strictly of degree 1 (l=1, m=0) representation, it is assumed that all other coecients are zero; all l > 1 are zero and all non-zero orders (m > 0) are also zero. This transforms Equation 3.1 into; V = a cos()ar2g01 + raq01(3.2) with the standard denition of P0 1 = cos(). Equation 3.2 indicates that this is a zonal model composing of the coecients g01 and q01, which are Ist and Est, respectively. It should also be noted that harmonics representation is in geomagnetic coordinates because the Dst index is a component of the eld along the dipole, which means the Ist and Est (which arise from Dst) are eectively and respectively g01 and q01 coecients in geomagnetic coordinates . The Est and Ist indices are actually a simple spherical harmonic representation of the ring current (Section 1.2.2) elds, so they can be used to generate the magnetic eld produced by the ring current and the currents it induces in the Earth. Equation 3.2 shows that the eld potential is colatitude dependent and not longitude dependent, therefore, making it easier to calculate a single correction to AU and AL i.e. the longitude that the observatories used to produce the indices can be neglected. All of the above is to build up to the correction of the AU and AL indices. The time- series of Est and Ist can be used to generate a time-series of the corresponding magnetic eld values. These eld values can then be subtracted from the AU and AL indices, and the resulting eect are investigated in this study. The MATLABr code for this correction was provided by Dr Hamilton. The code took in the Est and Ist values and calculated magnetic eld values at xed location i.e. the magnetic latitudes of the observatories that were used to produce AU and AL indices (Menvielle et al., 2011). The observatories have a narrow range of latitudes (refer to Table 8.2 in (Menvielle et al., 2011)), so as a rst approximation the latitudes were averaged and estimated to be about 65. The code produced three components of the eld, BX, BY , and BZ. The AU and AL are calculated from the eld horizontal to the ground, so in order to subtract from the indices, BX and BY components are used. However, the Est and Ist were only spherical harmonic of order 0 (m = 0) terms, therefore the output BY values from the code were all zero. So, the only horizontal eld component which would be subtracted from AU and AL hourly values was the BX component. This is an assumption since BY would not be completely zero in reality. It can be seen in the circled area in Figure 4.3 that the negative AU values coincide with the most negative BX values, indicating that BX is the most dominant component of the total eld. Therefore, the error from this assumption could be neglected. 16Chapter 4 Results This section presents the results and the discussion of the results. All of the numerical results are shown in Table 4.1. This study presents results from a recent 2000-2013 data, whose range covers a complete solar cycle and, therefore, gives a better overall check on the correlation. For each correlation, we rst start oby trying to reproduce the results by Newell et al. (2007) before moving on to looking at the results from using corrected indices. 4.1 Correlation between Dst and p1=2dMP =dt The study by Newell et al. (2007) shows only the correlation of the data from 1984- 1994 and 1995-2002. Between 1984-1994, the rst obvious thing that can be seen from comparing the two studies (Table4.1) is that the valid number of events in this study is only 112 valid events, which has reduced down from 96432 total possible events, while the previous study has 21418 events. The lower number of valid events in this study, therefore, gives a higher correlation coecient (r = 0:929) than that of the previous study (r = 0:857). This large dierence in the number of valid events could be due to a number of reasons. Dr.Hamilton also wrote a code for the same purpose and ran it along the side with my code. This acted as a conrmation, and if our results were dierent then we knew there were some errors. It could, therefore, be said with condence that the code really did produced 112 valid events during the 1984-1994 interval with the time integration method suggested by Newell et al. (2007) (Section 2.4). One possible cause of such a large dierence could be that, in the earlier years, the data were just not as continuous as the more current set. We were very strict with the selection of the valid events, so the solar wind time integration implemented in the MATLABr code only picked out blocks of completely continuous 72 time-series data and rejected the whole data block even if there was a single missing datum. It is also possible that Newell et al. (2007) were more relax about their selection criteria, since the amount of their valid events is quite high. Perhaps, they threw away bad values but, nevertheless, carried out the calculation, which could explain the slight dierences in the correlation coecient values. Also, the number of valid events in the later years was much closer to the previous study, and there were fewer rejected data, this supports the idea that 17strict data selection was the problem. In either case, it should be noted here that due to the small amount of valid events, any interpretations based on the 1984-1994 data are avoided in this study. In the case of the data from 1995-2002, the previous study has 59666 valid events while this study has 63589 valid events. The corresponding correlation coecients for the previous study and this study are 0:866 and 0:846, respectively. Again, the data set with more valid events appears to have a lower correlation coecient value. As for more up-to-date data set, from 2000-2013, the previous study does not have the analytical results presented. However, this study showed that from the data set of 2000-2013, 115139 valid events were used , which produced r = 0:856. The scatter plot of the correlation during 2000-2013 interval is shown in Figure 4.1(bottom right). Note that the correlation with Dst should be negative according to how the p1=2dMP =dt is dened. However, the negative signs are neglected because we are interested in the magnitude of the correlation coecients and also to better compare the results. 4.2 Correlation between Est and p1=2dMP =dt The previous section attempted to reproduce the results from the previous study by Newell et al. (2007). We will now look at the eect on the correlation when the Dst index is replaced by the Est index. After the Dst index is replaced with the Est index, the resulting correlation coecients appear to have improved (Table 4.1). The minimum improvement is in the 1995-2002 data set, with r going from 0:846 (Dst) to 0:847 (Est). The maximum improvement is in the 1984-1994 data set, with r = 0:929 (Dst) increased to r = 0:939 (Est), but again, due to the a small number of valid events, the results from 1984-1994 data are not robust enough for any conclusions to be drawn from. For the 2000-2013 data, the analytical results from this study shows that the corre- lation coecient increased from r = 0:856 (Dst) to r = 0:864(Est). The scatter plot of the data from the 2000-2013 interval is shown in Figure 4.1 (top). The changes in the correlation are very small, but this was to be expected. The scatter plot, Figure 4.2, shows the correlation between the Est and Dst indices. The high correlation coecient (r = 0:99) indicates that the two indices are very similar, showing that the Dst index is mostly made up of the contribution from the Est index (external source). This, therefore, explains the very small change in the correlation with both coupling functions when the Dst index is replaced with the Est index. 4.3 Correlation between Dst and ESR So far, it had been speculated that the correlation with the top coupling function p1=2dMP =dt , as claimed by Newell et al. (2007), could be improved by replacing the Dst index with the Est index. We then moved on to look at the second best coupling function ESR to see whether the claim made by Newell et al. (2007) about the top function would still hold after the corrections have been made and using new data (2000-2013). If the p1=2dMP =dt function is knocked oits top spot, this would mean that function is not as 18Index Year No. of Event (n) Magnitude of r Gradient Y-intercept Newell 's This study Newell's This study Coupling Function = p1=2dMP=dt Dst 1984 - 1994 21418 112 0.857 0.929 -0.0037 -23.50 Dst 1995 - 2002 59666 63589 0.866 0.846 -0.0041 -14.76 Dst 2000 - 2013 115139 0.856 -0.0037 -14.14 Est 1984 - 1994 112 0.939 -0.0031 -28.06 Est 1995 - 2002 63598 0.847 -0.0030 -20.83 Est 2000 - 2013 115139 0.864 -0.0030 -18.92 Coupling Function = dMP=dt AU 1983 - 1987 10352 11668 0.765 0.729 -0.0134 -21.34 AU(c) 1983 - 1987 11668 0.752 -0.0146 -21.67 AU 2000 - 2013 118434 0.683 -0.0123 -15.83 AU(c) 2000 - 2013 118434 0.717 -0.0137 -15.02 AL 1983 - 1987 10352 11668 0.528 0.762 -0.0326 4.21 AL(c) 1983 - 1987 11668 0.754 -0.0314 4.63 AL 2000 - 2013 118434 0.768 -0.0277 7.99 AL(c) 2000 - 2013 118434 0.755 -0.0263 7.25 Coupling Function = ESR Dst 1984 - 1994 21418 112 0.838 0.934 -0.0159 -27.47 Dst 1995 - 2002 59666 63589 0.860 0.852 -0.0159 -21.21 Dst 2000 - 2013 115139 0.853 -0.0145 -19.80 Est 1984 - 1994 112 0.942 -0.0126 -26.05 Est 1995 - 2002 63598 0.849 -0.0117 -23.71 Est 2000 - 2013 115139 0.851 -0.0117 -23.71 Table 4.1: The analytical results from the investigation of the relationship between dierent coupling functions and geomagnetic indices. `r' is the correlation coecient.

The Gradient and Y- intercept columns are the corresponding values from the line of best-t as shown as red lines in Figure 4.1. robust and may not correlate best with every indices as claimed by Newell et al. (2007). For the 1984-1994 data, the previous study (21418 valid events) produced r = 0:838, while our study (112 valid events) produced r = 0:934. For the 1995-2002 data, Newell et al. (2007)'s study (59666 valid events) produced r = 0:860, while our study(63589 valid events) produced r = 0:852. The 2000-2013 data has 115139 valid events and produced r = 0:853, ( corresponding scatter plot is shown in Figure 4.1, bottom left). Now, let us compare the correlation between the Dst index and the p1=2dMP =dt and the ESR functions from this study. For the data of 1984-1994 and 1995-2002 the coupling function ESR appears to correlate with Dst better than p1=2dMP =dt by 0.006 on average. However, p1=2dMP =dt function correlated with Dst better than ESR function for the 2000-2013 data by about 0.003 (Table 4.1). 19Although the dierences between the correlations from the two coupling functions are very small, it is enough to falsify the claim by Newell et al. (2007) because the results show that the p1=2dMP =dt function is not constantly better than the ESR function. Since Newell et al. (2007)'s dMP =dt does not seem to always be the best function, we then moved on to look at how this aect other indices, such as AU and AL. 4.4 Correlation between AU and dMP =dt Similar to previous sections, we rst attempted to reproduce the AU results from the previous study, and then moved on to look at the eect of replacing the AU index values with the corrected values on the correlation. As for the correlation between the coupling function, dMP =dt, and the AU index, the 1983-1987 OMNI 2 data set produced r = 0:729 (1668 valid events), while r = 0:765 (10352 valid events) for the previous study. This is not a bad attempt at reproducing the results from the study by Newell et al. (2007). The more current data from 2000 to 2013 is also presented in Table 4.1; the number of valid event is 118434, which is roughly 10 times the data from earlier years. This high number of valid events only produced r = 0:683. Again, these comparisons between the two studies only act as a guideline and are not so signicant for the purpose of this study since we are focusing on ways of improving the correlation of the data from the same source. Let us now compare the results, from OMNI 2 data, between the original AU index and the AU index that has been corrected using the process described in Section 3.2. For the 1983-1987 data, the correlation coecient has increase from 0:729 to 0:752, and from 0:683 to 0:717 for the 2000-2013 data. It is clear that the correction did improve the correlation between the AU index and the coupling function, but why? The correction, involved subtracting the northward (X) component of the eld, cal- culated from the Est and Ist indices values at the geomagnetic latitude of 65N, from the AU and AL indices. This process was done based on the idea that Est and Ist indices are a simple harmonic representation of the ring current eld. The top panel in Figure 4.3 shows a time-series plot plots of the AL index values (red), the AU index values (green), and the x-component values of the ring current (blue). The circled area on the plot contains some negative AU values, which seem to correspond to the period where the x-component of the ring current is most negative. This indicates a possible correlation between the two data set. From a numerical analysis, it was found that, on average, approximately 8% of the AU index and 6% of the AL index were due to the contribution from BX. The bottom panel in Figure 4.3 shows a time-series plot, from the 1995-2002 data, of the AU index values(blue) and the corrected AU index (AU-BX) values(red). It can be seen that most of the negative AU index values before the correction (blue) are now shifted to the less negative values. This, somewhat, is consistent with the theory that the negative and uncorrected AU index values are, in part, caused by the ring current. Thus, applying the correction to the AU index helped improve its correlation with the coupling function. 204.5 Correlation between AL and dMP =dt Similar to the previous section, for the 1983-1987 data, the study by Newell et al. (2007) has 10352 valid events while this study has 11668 valid events. However, the correlation coecient between the coupling function and the AL index from this study (r = 0:762) is higher than that of the previous study (r = 0:528). The OMNI 2 data set produced r = 0:768 for the 2000-2013 data. Let us now compare the AL index with with corrected AL index (Section 3.2) from OMNI 2 data set. For the 1983-1987 data, the correlation coecient decreased from 0:762 to 0:754, and also decreased from 0:768 to 0:755. The correction on the AL values appears to have a contrasting eect, comparing to the corrected AU values. There is no certain explanation why our AL results are better than Newell et al. (2007)'s, and worsened after the correction is applied. However, there is a possible expla- nation for this. Newell et al. (2007) proposed the solar wind integration time (Table 2.2) optimizing each index.The optimal valued of the weighting factor (w) and the number of hours of IMF (n) were chosen after a trial and error search which was done based on the results of AU and AL indices. This means that the w and n used are not optimal for the corrected version of the AU and AL indices. Newell et al. (2007) has ne-tuned the values used in the calculation of the coupling function dMP =dt assuming uncorrected AL and AL indices, so the correlation with the corrected AU and AL might have been improved if their analysis was to be repeated using the corrected AU and AL indices. 21Figure 4.1: Examples of some output scatter plots. Scatter plots of Est versus p1=2dMP =dt (top), Dst versus ESR (bottom left), and Dst versus p1=2dMP =dt (bottom right). Figure 4.2: A scatter plot showing the correlation between the Dst index and the Est index The hight, r = 0:99, correlation coecient indicates that the contribution of the Est index in making up the Dst index is more dominant than the contribution from Ist index. 22Figure 4.3: Top panel: A time-series scatter plot comparing the AL values (red), AU values (green), and x-component of the Ring Current (blue). The circled area shows that there is a possible correlation between the negative AU values and the x-component of ring current. Bottom panel: A times-series scatter plot comparing the AU index values(blue) with the corrected AU index values (red). 23Chapter 5 Discussion and Conclusion Newell et al. (2007) was only interested in the correlation coecients from the plots, such those shown in Figure 4.1, but the (red) best-t lines on those correlation plots could be used to predict the Dst/Est/AU/AL from solar wind parameters. The `Gradient' and the `Y-intercept' are presented in Table 4.1. The indices prediction could be done by using the gradient to scale down the x-axis (coupling functions) and apply an oset (y-intercept) to determine the index value on the y-axis. Regardless of the exact values, the dierence between p1=2dMP =dt and ESR for the 1995-2002 Dst data in the study by Newell et al. (2007) is very small. It is possible that what Newell et al. (2007)is arguing is that their coupling function, dMP =dt, is the best coupling function across all the indices they studied. This project proposed and investigated the hypothesis that magnetic disturbances can be better predicted by replacing the Dst index with the Est index. The hypothesis is not true for the case of the coupling function ESR. Once the Dst index is replaced with the Est index, the correlation coecients produced from the 1995-2002 and 2000-2013 data are lower than before the replacement.The rst conjecture was the possibility of the ESR function having dierent solar wind integration time (Table 2.2) from the p1=2dMP =dt function. However, the time integration was done after the calculation of the coupling functions, which means that the the optimization of the solar wind parameters and the optimization of the coupling functions are two independent operations. Therefore, the integration time should not be specic to a particular coupling function. However, after all the corrections and using more recent data from 2000-2013, the coupling function p1=2dMP =dt produced higher correlation coecients than the coupling function ESR, overall. The dierence is very small which is due to the fact that Est and Dst are extremely well correlated (r = 0:99), even if they can dier a bit in amplitude. So, when correlating with Solar Wind parameters, any improvement will be small compared to the failings of the coupling function (r 0:85). It is, nevertheless, an improvement on the prediction model. Therefore, it can be used to support our hypothesis that better prediction of the magnetic disturbances could be done by replacing the Dst index with the Est index, which correlates better with solar wind parameters, through the coupling function, p1=2dMP =dt. Since the results from this rst set of investigation were not so straightforward, the study extended to look at the correlation of a few more indices, AU and AL. Regarding the results from the correlation between the AU and AL indices with the 24coupling function dMP =dt (Table 4.1), it was found that roughly 8% of the AU index and 6% of the AL index were the contribution from the x-component of the ring current. However, it can be said that the correction improved the correlation for the AU index, but was not so for the AL index. Overall, the improvement in the AU index is quantitatively better than the worsening of the AL index. All of the factors that went into calculating the coupling functions proposed by Newell et al. (2007) was ne-tuned, some through trial and error, to be optimal for the indices values they used. However, in this study, many magnetic indices were corrected, therefore, the factors which had been optimized for uncorrected values may not have worked as well. If more time was available I would like to extend this investigation across more indices, in order to really test Newell et al. (2007)'s claims. Also, I would like to focus on just one complete solar cycle and investigate the seasonal eect on the AU index. From the bottom panel of Figure 4.3, it can be seen that the AU values are at maximum around the middle of the year while at minimum around the end and the beginning of each year. It would be interesting to see whether these trends occur recursively and can be predicted. If the trends are there, then how do they aect the prediction model.
